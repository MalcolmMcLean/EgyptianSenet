# Egyptian Senet

An implementation of this ancient Egyptian board game. We don't know the rules,
so feel free to modify the source to create your own rules.

## To play
Click on the sticks, which the Egyptians used instead of dice. That gives you
how far a pawn can move. Hover over your pawns, and when you get a blue light,
that means the pawn is moveable. Click, then hover over the space you want
to move it to. You will get a blue light if the move is legal. Then click
again to move your pawn. wait a few moments for the computer opponent to play.

## To compile
We're on CMake.

      mkdir build
      cmake ..

Then compile in the Visual Studio IDE.

If you don't have CMake, create a new Visual Studio project manually nad drop the
files into it.
